## What's this?

This plugin fixes some Cyberpunk 2077 issues and adds some features.

Works with 1.11.

### Current fixes

| Patches      | Description     |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Debug Menu | Enables the debug menus in game so you can ~~cheat~~, investigate...  |
| Skip start menu | Skips the menu asking you to press space bar to continue (Breaching...) |
| Remove pedestrians and traffic | Removes most of the pedestrians and traffic |
| Disable Async Compute | Disables async compute, this can give a boost on older GPUs (Nvidia 10xx series for example)|
| Disable Antialiasing TAA | Disables antialiasing, not recommended but you do what you want! |
| Disable Windows 7 VSync | Disables VSync on Windows 7 to bypass the 60 FPS limit |
